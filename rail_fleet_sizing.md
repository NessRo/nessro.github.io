## Rail Car Fleet Sizing Simulation Application

**Project description:** 

purpose of the app is to simulate rail transportation cycle times in order to determine the optimal rail car fleet size given a weekly demand parameter.

the technical stack includes:

* Azure Web App Services

* Azure Blob Storage

* Python

* Linux OS

* FastAPI web framework

### 1. The Business Problem

as an enteprise that uses rail cars as part of its supply chain to ship product to customers, you must determine and lease rail cars to satisfy a fixed weekly demand. there is inherit variability in the transit times from the origin and destination of a rail cars journey.

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
