# Questionaire Builder

**Project description:** 

This project is a web-based application that enables users to build custom questionnaires/forms quickly and easily. The app is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, and it features a robust set of tools for creating, editing, and sharing forms.

The application is built using a tech stack that includes JavaScript React, React-Redux, and FastAPI Python web framework. The frontend is built with React and Redux, which provide a powerful and efficient user interface. The backend is powered by FastAPI, which is a modern, fast, and lightweight Python web framework that makes it easy to build APIs.

The app allows users to create questionnaires/forms from scratch or choose from a library of pre-built templates. Users can add a variety of question types, including multiple-choice, short answer, and long answer questions. The app also provides a range of customization options, such as adding images and logos, changing fonts and colors, and more.
                         
# 1. The Business Problem

The business problem that the software app is trying to solve is the challenge of creating and distributing custom questionnaires/forms quickly and efficiently. Traditional methods of creating questionnaires/forms, such as using spreadsheets or paper-based forms, can be time-consuming and error-prone. Additionally, distributing and tracking responses to these forms can be a logistical nightmare, especially for large organizations or teams.

By solving this business problem, the app can help businesses and organizations improve their operational efficiency, gather valuable data and insights, and ultimately make better decisions. Whether it's for market research, employee feedback, customer satisfaction surveys, or any other use case, our app offers a powerful and flexible solution for creating and distributing custom questionnaires/forms.

# 2. The Solution

The approach taken to solve this specific business problem involves a statistical simulation of a railcar's journey, utilizing descriptive statistics such as mean, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation. 

The solution runs 10 simulations, each spanning 365 days, with varying fleet sizes. The simulation plots the achieved service levels, fleet size variations, and the amount of demand satisfied versus the expected demand. 

Managers are then expected to make a decision on fleet size based on the desired service level they wish to achieve for the customer demand.

# 3. How it works

Our software app for building questionnaires/forms works by providing a simple and intuitive user interface for creating, customizing, and sharing forms. The process is broken down into several easy steps:

1.	Choose a template or start from scratch: Users can choose from a library of pre-built templates or create a new form from scratch.
2.	Add questions: Users can add a variety of question types, such as multiple-choice, short answer, and long answer questions. They can also customize each question with images, videos, and other multimedia elements.
3.	Customize the design: Users can customize the design of their form by changing the fonts, colors, and other visual elements.
4.	Share the form: Once the form is complete, users can share it with others via a unique URL or embed code.
5.	Track responses: The app provides powerful analytics tools that enable users to track responses, view response rates, and generate reports.

Our software app is built using JavaScript React, React-Redux, and FastAPI Python web framework, which provide a fast and efficient user interface and a powerful backend. Overall, our app provides a simple and efficient solution for creating and sharing custom questionnaires/forms.
